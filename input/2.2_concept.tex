The thesis also highlights remaining issues not addressed by the recommended technique and suggests new ideas to further improve the chosen architecture.

A proof-of-concept is implemented in PHP as a standalone open source library and made available as part of an experimental stateful application framework.

To informally test the solution in a large-scale failover scenario, a rudimentary demo application is provided in the form of a Docker\footnote{\url{https://www.docker.com/}} container and deployed to a number of interconnected cluster nodes on cloud hosting provider DigitalOcean\footnote{\url{https://www.digitalocean.com/}}.
