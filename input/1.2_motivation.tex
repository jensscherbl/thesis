Enterprise applications often serve vast amounts of users and process a rapidly growing mass of data. Hence, PHP developers now also need to consider load distribution and failover scenarios in order to accommodate these increasing demands.

Perhaps the most interesting question in this context is how to maintain session state across large numbers of interconnected application nodes – preferably in a way that is transparent to application developers and does not sacrifice consistency or performance.

While other ecosystems have been targeting enterprise customers from the very beginning and already provide reasonable functionality as part of their larger runtime environments, PHP is still limited to insufficient workarounds and proprietary third-party solutions in that regard.
