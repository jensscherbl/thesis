Existing approaches for the platform usually rely on shared file systems or external data stores, adding extra complexity to an ever-expanding software stack and generally making the set up and maintenance of the necessary infrastructure more difficult. For stateful applications, however, there is an opportunity to radically change how session data is handled in PHP – distributed or otherwise.

The thesis makes a meaningful contribution in this field by proposing a viable open source implementation based on more appropriate techniques – written directly in PHP and free of dependencies on additional software components.
