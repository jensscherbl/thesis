The survey analyzes common use cases involving session state in various types of web applications and further identifies their functional and non-functional requirements, especially in terms of potential failure scenarios in distributed environments.

Different strategies for distributed session handling have previously been evaluated and compared. Thus, most advantages and disadvantages of the existing options are already well understood. Some of the larger software and service providers even offer their own proprietary solutions, combining multiple techniques to avoid the most obvious pitfalls.

The survey gives an extensive overview of the most commonly suggested approaches, provides a systematic review of existing studies and narrows down the field to only the most viable concepts. Most importantly, it reaches a conclusive recommendation based on the examined architectures and the previously identified requirements.
